# TDD katas

Here I have different tdd katas written with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
One day I realize that I can learn how to write difficult programs or modules
just rewriting it every day for half an hour.

Thanks to my [Team Leader](https://github.com/Dmitry404) for suggestion to write katas every day :D

# Run tests
```shell
$ cd <kata_name>
$ cargo test day_#
```
or

```shell
$ cargo test --all
```
